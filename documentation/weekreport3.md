## What did i do this week?

Created ArrayMethods class to perform some vector operations and clean up the code a little bit. Implemented the planned 2 player CFR solution so we get a nash-equilibrium approximation. Wrote tests for both of these and fixed circleci and codecov so its easier to see test coverage.


## Has the program progressed this week?

Yes, all goals have been achieved.

## What did i learn this week.

I got a much better clearer image how the algorithm works which will help me on the next goal of implementing it on a game that is on extended-form.

## What was unclear?

Small difficulties with python imports as always.

## What will i do next.

Implement it on a extended-form game.
