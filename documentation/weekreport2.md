## What did i do this week?

Implemented CFR algorithm for rock paper scissors game which solves an exploitable strategy against opponents fixed strategy. RPS is a normal-form game where all the players only pick a single choice so the graphs discussed in last weeks report have not been implemented yet and isnt applicable to Rock paper scissors.


## Has the program progressed this week?

A working version has been achieved that i can build on in the upcoming weeks.

## What did i learn this week.

Exploitable strategies in RPS dont look what i think they look like which made me think my code was bugged.

## What was unclear?

Read above.

## What will i do next.

Implement it so both players are using CFR instead of just one so instead of a exploitable solution we get a NASH-equilibrium one where neither player can improve their strategy by adjusting.
